# Daggit

An experiment in alternative GUI to Git.

# What is this?

The inspiration behind Daggit is based on the observation that Git is best learned bottom up. Git is built on some very simple and elegant ideas, but this simplicity is masked by the complexity of its command line interface. There are many graphical user interfaces for Git out there but most of them either artificially limit access to the real power of Git or feel contrived. You ultimately end up spending quite an amount of time learning Git commands if you want get anything non trivial done.

Git is fundamentally a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and graphs can be very effectively visualized and operated on. Daggit is basically a DAG editor for Git.
